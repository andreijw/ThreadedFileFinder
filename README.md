# Problem Statement
You are to write a command line application that searches a directory tree (i.e. - including
subdirectories) for filenames that contain anywhere in them a specified substring.
The application takes the directory to search as the first command line argument, followed by
one or more substrings (literals, not wildcards) to search for.
file-finder <dir> <substring1>[<substring2> [<substring3>]...]

# Assumptions
- Cross platform c++ project (created using cmake) some testing needs to be done on Linux and mac systems
- The application will be run from the command line with correct permissions.
- The application will run with read access to the directory and files. No ACL checks are performed.
